    "### 1. **Significant Early Onset Shifts in Summer and Monsoon**\n",
    "   - **Species with Largest Shifts**: *Copper-pod (Peltophorum pterocarpum)*, *Coconut palm (Cocos nucifera)*, and *Indian Almond (Terminalia catappa)* show significant shifts in onset timing, particularly in the **Summer** and **Monsoon** seasons, with onset weeks moving earlier by up to 3 weeks.\n",
    "   - **Possible Interpretation**: This trend of earlier onset in Summer and Monsoon could suggest that these species are responding to changing seasonal cues, possibly due to warmer or more favorable conditions occurring earlier in these seasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Mixed Onset Shifts in Post-Monsoon and Winter**\n",
    "   - In **Post-Monsoon** and **Winter**, the average onset shifts are generally smaller and less consistent across species, with both earlier and later onset observed.\n",
    "   - **Key Observation**: For instance, *Pride of India (Lagerstroemia speciosa)* showed a delayed onset of around 1.3 weeks in Post-Monsoon, while *Chiku Sapodilla (Manilkara zapota)* in Winter had an earlier onset by 1 week.\n",
    "   - **Implication**: The variability in Winter and Post-Monsoon onset shifts may indicate a more complex interaction with climate, where some species experience delays due to potentially cooler or altered post-monsoon conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Notable Changes in Growth Trends in Winter and Monsoon**\n",
    "   - **Top Species with Trend Changes**: *Red Silk Cotton (Bombax ceiba)* in Winter and *Coconut Palm (Cocos nucifera)* in Monsoon experienced the most substantial trend changes, with slopes decreasing by over 0.29, indicating a reduction in growth rates in these seasons post-2020.\n",
    "   - **Broader Pattern**: Many species, including *Pongam Tree (Pongamia pinnata)*, *Drumstick Tree (Moringa oleifera)*, and *Peepal (Ficus religiosa)*, showed decreasing trends across Winter and Monsoon.\n",
    "   - **Potential Climate Impact**: This decrease in trend slopes for growth in Winter and Monsoon suggests that these species may be experiencing stress or limitations in their typical growth patterns, possibly due to less favorable conditions (e.g., reduced rainfall or temperature changes) in these seasons post-2020.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Average Seasonal Shift Patterns**\n",
    "   - **Overall Seasonal Impact**: On average, **Summer** shows a positive shift of 0.32 weeks, while **Monsoon** and **Winter** show slight negative shifts, with Monsoon having the most substantial change of -0.35 weeks.\n",
    "   - **Implications for Seasonal Cycles**: These shifts indicate that species in Kerala may be adapting to earlier summer conditions, while Monsoon and Winter may be shifting slightly later or becoming less predictable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "The data suggests that:\n",
    "- **Earlier onset** in Summer and Monsoon for many species could be an adaptation to changing seasonal cues.\n",
    "- **Reduced growth trends** in Winter and Monsoon, especially for species like *Red Silk Cotton* and *Coconut Palm*, may indicate stress or climate-related impacts affecting growth during these periods.\n",
    "- These findings point to a broader pattern of climate adaptation, where species are shifting growth cycles or experiencing altered growth rates in response to changing environmental conditions in Kerala.\n"

    "key questions we can answer using our current analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Questions and Answers\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **How are trees changing because of climate change?**\n",
    "   - By comparing the onset shifts and trend slopes between the reference period (2014-2020) and post-2020, we observe that some species, particularly *Copper-pod* and *Coconut palm*, have shown earlier onset weeks, especially in the Summer and Monsoon seasons. These earlier growth patterns could be an adaptation to changing climate conditions, like warmer temperatures or shifting rainfall patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **What is the onset time for flowering and fruiting in tropical species?**\n",
    "   -The onset shifts calculated for the top 30 observed species provide an average onset week for each season, allowing us to identify how early or late these phenological stages occur on average. For example, Summer onset shifts were generally earlier in post-2020 data, which could suggest a trend towards earlier development in response to climate signals.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **How fast do trees change in response to changing seasons?**\n",
    "   -  The slope comparisons reveal how quickly growth trends are changing over time, with several species showing decreased trend slopes in the post-2020 period. This suggests that certain species might be experiencing slowed or reduced growth rates, possibly due to altered seasonal conditions or increased environmental stress.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **How has the probability of flowering and fruiting in a given season changed since 2014?**\n",
    "   - While this question is designed to be answered probabilistically, our onset and trend analyses already show that flowering and fruiting stages are shifting earlier in some seasons. This indirectly suggests that the likelihood of these phenological events happening in a given season may be increasing or decreasing due to climate changes. Further probability-based modeling could refine this insight.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Do certain seasons show more pronounced shifts in timing or growth patterns?**\n",
    "   -  According to the average onset shifts, **Summer** and **Monsoon** seasons display more pronounced shifts towards earlier onset timing. This pattern suggests that these seasons may be experiencing stronger climate-driven impacts, which is further supported by the general trend of reduced slopes in growth patterns across these seasons.\n",
