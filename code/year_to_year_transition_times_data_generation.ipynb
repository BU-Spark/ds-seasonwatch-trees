    "## Finding transition weeks\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a transition week?\n",
    "Transition weeks are the starting and ending week of a phenophase, for example, the first and last weeks of a tree's 'budding flowers' period. We can think of transition weeks as the first week that the percent of observations observing an attribute (say budding flowers) exceeds some small threshold, such as 10%.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Our approach\n",
    "We compute probability distributions for the start transition week and end transition week, $p_{start}$ and $p_{end}$, which range over all weeks in a year. We do this by normalizing score functions, $s_{start}$ and $s_{end}$, which are computed with respect to the plots of the percentage of observations each week of a species which observe a particular attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Start transition score function\n",
    "$s_{start}(w)$ is large for weeks $w$ which are likely to be a start transition week. Let $y(w)$ be the percentage of observations for a species which observe the attribute in week $w$. Then:   \n",
    "$$\n",
    "    s_{start}(w) = w_1 \\left(\\frac{1}{0.1 + \\left|\\max_{w - L \\leq k \\leq w} y(k) - \\min_{w - L \\leq k \\leq w} y(k)\\right|}\\right)^2 + w_2 (\\max\\left(y(w+M) - y(w), 0\\right))\n",
    "$$\n",
    "a weighted sum over two terms. The first term, which we refer to as stagnation, computes the difference between the maximum and minimum percentages from $L$ weeks before week $w$ through week $w$ and is large when this difference is small. The second term, which we refer to as spike, computes the change in percentage from week $w$ to week $w+M$. This term is large when there is a large increase in percentage from week $w$ to week $w+M$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### End transition score function\n",
    "$s_{end}(w)$ is large for weeks $w$ which are likely to be an end transition week. Let $y(w)$ be the percentage of observations for a species which observe the attribute in week $w$. Then:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    s_{end}(w) = w_1 \\left(\\frac{1}{0.1 + \\left|\\max_{w \\leq k \\leq w+L} y(k) - \\min_{w \\leq k \\leq w+L} y(k)\\right|}\\right)^2 + w_2 (\\max\\left(y(w-M) - y(w), 0\\right))\n",
    "$$\n",
    "a weighted sum over two terms. In this case, the stagnation term, computes the difference between the maximum and minimum percentages from week $w$ through week $w+L$ and is large when this difference is small. The second term, which we refer to as spike, computes the change in percentage from week $w-M$ to week $w$. This term is large when there is a large decrease in percentage from week $w-M$ to week $w$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Computing the probability distributions\n",
    "We compute the distribution $p_{start}$, the probability that a given week is the start transition week, by normalizing the score function $s_{start}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    p_{start}(w) = \\frac{s_{start}(w)}{\\sum_{w \\in Y} s_{start}(w)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We compute the distribution $p_{end}$, the probability that a given week is the start transition week, by normalizing the score function $s_{end}$.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    p_{end}(w) = \\frac{s_{end}(w)}{\\sum_{w \\in Y} s_{end}(w)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Computing Means and Standard Deviations\n",
    "Means and standard deviations are computed using the same process for $p_{start}$ and $p_{end}$. Let $w_{a}$ be a start week. We compute the mean start transition time $\\mu_{start}$ as follows:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    \\mu_{start} = \\sum_{w = w_a}^{w_a + 48}w \\cdot p_{start}(w)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "We compute the standard deviation of $p_{start}$, $\\sigma_{start}$ as follows:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    \\sigma_{start} = \\sqrt{\\sum_{w = w_a}^{w_a + 48}(w - \\mu_{start})^2 \\cdot p_{start}(w)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "In practice, we center our 48 week window over which means and standard deviations are computed around local maxima in the score function. So $w_a$ ends up being 24 weeks before each local maximum.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tuning Model Parameters $w_1, w_2, L, M$\n",
    "Parameters to tune are $L$ (stagnation window size), $M$ (spike window size), $w_1$ (stagnation weight), and $w_2$ (spike weight). Our best practice currently is to set $w_2=1$, $w_1 = 0.25$, which reduces the amount stagnation factors into the score, ensuring that flat periods at the peaks of the percentage plot do not get high scores. We set $L=5$, which we found to be a reasonable number of weeks to look check back to identify periods of little change in the percentage plot of an attribute for a species. Most significantly, we set $M=15$, which we found to be a reasonable estimate of the number of weeks between the transition week and the peak week of the phenophase."
